<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Over</span> Street Ballads may be raised the wail of “Ichabod, Ichabod, their
glory is departed.” They held their own for many centuries, bravely and
well, but have succumbed to a changed order of things, and a new
generation has arisen, who will not stop in the streets to listen to
these ballads being sung, but prefer to have their music served up to
them “piping hot,” with the accompaniment of warmth, light, beer, and
tobacco (for which they duly have to pay) at the Music Halls; but
whether the change be for the better, or not, may be a moot question.</p>

<p>These Street Ballads were produced within a very few hours of the
publication of any event of the slightest public interest; and, failing
that, the singers had always an unlimited store to fall back upon, on
domestic, or humorous subjects, love, the sea, etc., etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span> Of their
variety we may learn something, not only from this book, but from the
ballad of “Chaunting Benny” of which the following is a portion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="idtts">..........<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“My songs have had a tidy run, I’ve plenty in my fist, Sirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if you wish to pick one out, I’ll just run through my list, Sirs.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Have you seen “My daughter Fan,” “She wore a wreath of roses,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here you see “My son Tom,” “The Sun that lights the roses,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Green grow the rushes O,” “On the Banks of Allan Water,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Such a getting out of bed,” with “Brave Lord Ullin’s daughter.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Poor Bessie was a Sailor’s bride,” “Sitting on a rail,” Sirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Is there a heart that never loved?” “The Rose of Allandale,” Sirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The Maid of Judah,” “Out of Place,” with “Plenty to be sad at,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I say, my rum un, who are you?” with “What a shocking bad hat,” etc., etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Rough though some of these Street Ballads may be, very few of them were
coarse, and, on reading them, we must ever bear in mind the class for
whom they were produced, who listened to them, and&mdash;practical proof of
interest&mdash;bought them. In this collection I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vii" id="page_vii">{vii}</a></span> have introduced nothing
which can offend anybody except an absolute prude; in fact, “My bear
dances only to the genteelest of tunes.”</p>

<p>There are plenty of my readers old enough to remember many of these
Ballads, and they will come none the worse because they bring with them
the reminiscence of their youth. <i>Forsan et hæc olim meminisse juvabit.</i>
They owe a great deal of their charm to the fact that they were
absolutely contemporary with the events they describe, and, though
sometimes rather faulty in their history, owing to the pressure under
which they were composed and issued, yet those very inaccuracies prove
their freshness.</p>

<p>The majority were illustrated&mdash;if, indeed, any can be called
illustrated&mdash;for the woodcuts were generally served out with a charming
impartiality, and without the slightest regard to the subject of the
ballad. What previous work these blocks had served, goodness only knows;
they were probably bought at trade sales, and had illustrated books that
were out of date or unsaleable. They vary from the sixteenth century to
Bewick, some of whose works are occasionally met with; but, taking them
as a whole, we must fain con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span>fess that art as applied to these Ballads
was at its very lowest. Their literary merit is not great&mdash;but what can
you expect for half-a-crown? which was the price which Jemmy Catnach,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
of Monmouth Court, Seven Dials, used to pay for their production.
Catnach issued a large number from his press (in fact, his successor,
Fortey, advertised that he had four thousand different sorts for sale),
and his name is used as a “household word” to designate this class of
Ballad. But, in fact, he only enjoyed the largest share of the London
trade, whilst the Provinces were practically independent&mdash;Liverpool,
Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Preston, Hull, Sheffield, Durham,
etc., had their own ballad-mongers, who wrote somewhat after the manner
of the author of “The Bard of Seven Dials.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“And it’s my plan, that some great man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dies with a broken head, Sirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vith a bewail, I does detail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His death ’afore e’s dead, Sirs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while his friends and foes contends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They all my papers buy, Sirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, vithout doubt, I sells ’em out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Cos there my talent lies, Sirs.”<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_ix" id="page_ix">{ix}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p>The Ballad singers and vendors made money rapidly over any event which
took the popular fancy&mdash;a good blood-curdling murder being very
profitable; and the business required very little capital, even that
being speedily turned over. Generally, the singers worked singlehanded,
but sometimes two would join, and then the Ballad took an antiphonal
form, which must have relieved them very much, and the crowd which
gathered round them was the surest proof that their vocal efforts were
appreciated.</p>

<p>They are gone&mdash;probably irrevocably&mdash;but a trace of the vendor still
lingers amongst us. One or two still remain about Gray’s Inn Road,
Farringdon Road, and other neighbourhoods; but I venture to say, as they
drop out, they will find no successors. You may know them, if ever lucky
enough to meet with one, by their canvas screens, on which are pinned
the ballads&mdash;identical with that immortal screen of which Mr. Silas Wegg
(in Dickens’s “Our Mutual Friend”) was the proud proprietor; but these
modern Ballads are mostly reproductions of Music Hall songs, and have
very little in common with those about which I write.</p>

<p>I have taken the first fifty years of this century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span> when this style of
Street Ballad was at its best, but I have liberally interpreted my fifty
years, by extending its margin by a year or two either way&mdash;thus, I
include the Mutiny at the Nore in 1798, and the Great Exhibition of
1851, and I have selected those that bear on most, and elucidate best,
the social manners and customs of that period.</p>

<h3>SALE OF A WIFE.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nind">Whenever a foreigner used to write that Englishmen sold their wives
in open market, with halters round their necks, they were not
believed in England; but it was nevertheless a fact, and even as
lately as last year a man sold his wife. In two of my books (“Old
Times” and “The Dawn of the Nineteenth Century”) I have given
numerous instances. The halter round the neck was used when the
wife was sold at market, it being considered that, being thus
accoutred, she was on a level with the cattle, and thus could
legally be sold. </p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Wives at the market did not fetch good prices; the highest I know
of, is recorded in <i>The Times</i>, September 19, 1797: “An hostler’s
wife, in the country, lately fetched twenty-five guineas.” But this
was extravagance, as, with the exception of a man who exchanged his
wife for an ox, which he sold for six guineas, the next highest
quotation is three and a half guineas; but this rapidly dwindled
down to shillings, and even pence. In 1881, a wife was sold at
Sheffield for a quart of beer; in 1862, another<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span> was purchased at
Selby Market Cross for a pint; and the <i>South Wales Daily News</i>,
May 2, 1882, tells us that one was parted with for a glass of ale.

<div class="blockquot"><p>In every civilized society there is an antagonism between employer
and employed, between capital and labour. The men do not often take
thought of the losses their employers have sustained, in order to
keep their factories going and their hands employed; they do not
think that England has to compete with the whole world, and that,
on the Continent, wages are cheaper, and the men are more contented
with their lot, so that when a depression in trade occurs, it is
only fair that they should bear a portion of the burden. There are
plenty of demagogues, who, for pay, will fan the flame of
discontent, and the result is a <i>strike</i>, injurious to all parties.
On the other hand, a man has a right to sell his labour as dearly
as he can, or to refuse to sell it at all, if he so pleases, and a
strike is very often the means of his getting an advance of wages
which might not have been otherwise conceded, or at all events
tardily granted.</p>

<p>Naturally there are many street ballads on this vital subject to
the ballad-singer’s listeners, but I have only selected one, which
appears to me to be fairly typical. As an antidote to the
discontent and privation consequent on bad trade, Henry Russell
wrote, “There’s a good time coming, boys,” which enjoyed immense
popularity, and did much to banish the black spirit of discontent. </p></div>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Ballads</span> exemplifying the first half of the present Century would be
incomplete without some mention of coaching. It was essentially a
horsey age, for railways were not, at least during the first
quarter, the first (Stockton and Darlington) being opened September
27, 1825, so that people were obliged to rely on horses for their
means of locomotion to any distance. Great improvement had been
made in the construction of the stagecoaches, and they were very
well horsed; in fact, with the exception of their being larger,
they were very much like those which now run to Brighton,
Guildford, etc.</p>

<p>Bob Logic, who is supposed to have written the subjoined ballad,
was the companion of Corinthian Tom and Jerry Hawthorn, whose
pranks were so graphically described by Pierce Egan in his “Life in
London.” The George Shillibeer who is sung in the last verse was a
large coach proprietor, even letting out hearses and
mourning-coaches.&mdash;Nay, almost everything on wheels. To him is due
the introduction of the Omnibus, the first of which ran from the
Yorkshire Stingo, Marylebone Road, to the Bank of England, on July
4, 1829. </p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span></p>

<h3>HURRAH FOR FATHER MATHEW’S MILL.</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Two</span> jolly old topers once sat at an inn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discussing the merits of brandy and gin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said one to the other, I’ll tell you what, Bill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ve been hearing, to day, of Father Mathew’s Mill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You must know that this comical Mill has been built,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of old broken casks, when the liquor’s been spilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You go up the steps, and when at the door sill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’ve a paper to sign at Father Mathew’s Mill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You promise, by signing the paper (I think),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ale, wine and spirits, you never will drink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’ll give up, as they call it, such rascally swill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then you go into Father Mathew’s Mill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There’s a wheel in this Mill that they call “self denial,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They turn it a bit, just to give you a trial;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old clothes are made new ones, and if you’ve been ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’re very soon cured in Father Mathew’s Mill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bill listened, and wondered, at length he cried out&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Why, Tom, if it’s true what you’re telling about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What fools we must be, to be here sitting still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us go and look in at Father Mathew’s Mill.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They gazed with amazement, for up came a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With disease and excesses, his visage was wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He mounted the steps&mdash;signed the pledge with good will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And went for a turn in Father Mathew’s Mill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He quickly came out quite the picture of health,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And walked briskly on in the highway of wealth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as onward he pressed, he shouted out still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Success to the wheel of Father Mathew’s Mill!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The next that went in were a man and his wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many long years they’d been living in strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had beat and abused her, and swore he would kill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his heart took a turn in Father Mathew’s Mill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when he came out, oh how altered was he!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His conduct was changed; and how happy was she!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They no more contended&mdash;no, you shan’t&mdash;yes, I will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But together they’re blessing Father Mathew’s Mill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then next came a fellow as grim as a Turk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To curse and to swear seemed his principal work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He swore that that morning, his skin he would fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, drunk as he was, he reeled into the Mill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But what he saw there, sure I never could tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his Conduct was changed, and his language as well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw, when he turned round the brow of the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he knelt and thanked God for Father Mathew’s Mill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The poor were made rich, the rich were made strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shot<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> was made short, and the purse was made long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These miracles puzzled both Thomas and Bill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length they went in for Father Mathew’s Mill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A little time after, I heard a great shout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turned round to see what the noise was about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a crowd, among which were both Thomas and Bill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were shouting hurrah for Father Mathew’s Mill.<br /></span>

swallow-tailed coats and tall hats, and were the subjects of

change of costume to the tunic and helmet has induced a better

to enter. A fire occurred there, and some of his children were
burnt. William Thompson, <i>alias</i> Bendigo, was a native of
Nottingham, and was a professional pugilist from his twenty-first
year of age. </p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> fight scarcely comes within the scope of this work, but I
introduce it, because it was supposed to be the last of
Prizefighting. Unfortunately, the brutal sport has been revived,
but it can never attain the dimensions and importance it enjoyed
during the latter part of the reign of George III. and the whole of
that of George IV. Gully was page to that monarch and M.P. for
Pontefract, and Jackson was a gentleman, after his kind.</p>

<p>Sayers was of Irish extraction, though born at Brighton. Heenan’s
parents were also Irish, although America was the place of his
birth. The fight between these two took place on April 17, 1860,
near Farnborough. They fought thirty-seven rounds in two hours and
twenty minutes. Sayers was all but helpless, and Heenan, although
full of fight&mdash;indeed, he ran <i>amuck</i> of every body at last&mdash;was
blind, when the police and spectators broke into the ring, and a
more disgraceful scene was never witnessed, even at a prize-fight.
Many noblemen and Members of Parliament attended this fight; in
fact, many of the latter made a subscription in Sayers’ behalf, as
also did the Members of Lloyd’s, the Stock Exchange, and the
brokers in Mark Lane&mdash;clogged, however, with the condition that he
should fight no more. Altogether over three thousand pounds were
subscribed and invested for the benefit of his children, he
receiving the interest for life. He became partner and afterwards
proprietor of Howe’s and Cushing’s Circus&mdash;at which he lost all the
money he had. He drank fearfully, and shortly afterwards died of
consumption, aged thirty-nine. His tomb may be seen in Highgate
Cemetery. </p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Louis Antoine Jullien</span> was born at Sisteron, Basses Alpes, April 23,
1812. His father was a band-master, hence probably his love of
music. He knew well how to cater for a popular taste, and to him we
owe not only the Promenade Concerts, which have brought good music
into the amusements of the people, but a vast improvement in the
English orchestra. His band was the best of its time; indeed, he
spared no expense to procure the very best instrumental and vocal
performers. He died March 14, 1860. As a composer, dance music was
his great forte, and he was the first to seize on the Polka, which
was introduced into England about 1844. This dance became an
absolute <i>furore</i>. Everything was Polka&mdash;Polka jackets, bonnets,
cigars, etc. In fact, as one popular song ran&mdash;</p>

mainsail, and sometimes not; rigged very much like a cutter. They
are said to have taken their name from being hailed (“Ahoy”) to
stop to take in passengers. The good people of that date were
rather given to stay at home, or not go farther seawards than
Gravesend. Ramsgate and Margate were long voyages, and in truth
they were so sometimes; in rough weather they were sometimes two
days or more making the passage. But there were other dangers, vide
<i>Drakard’s Paper</i>, October 3, 1813:&mdash;“The <i>British Queen</i>, Margate
Hoy, detained full of passengers, for having accidentally had
communication with a vessel performing quarantine, has been since
released by orders from the Admiralty. The distresses of the
passengers partook of the serio-comic: at first provisions were
very scanty, and they had no prospect but seven weeks of durance.
This to the trippers to the seaside for a week would have been a
serious affair.” </p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nind">This song, was, as far I can find, introduced by Grimaldi in Thos.
J. Dibdin’s famous Pantomime of “Mother Goose,” which in 1806-7 had
the unprecedented run of a hundred and fifty nights, and was a
favourite for very many years. When Pantomimes were Pantomimes, and
not mere spectacles, the clowns were real clowns (the Shakesperian
and French hybrids not having been born), and the names of
Grimaldi, Matthews, and others will go down to posterity. No
Pantomime was complete without the clown singing this song, which
was always encored, and, as a substitute, invariably was given
“Tippetiwitchet,” of which the theme was an intoxicated man.
Perhaps, if revived, Modern Society would not appreciate them, but
forty or fifty years ago tastes were not so superfine, and these
clowns and their songs afforded hilarious amusement. </p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147">{147}</a></span></p>

<h3>THE ONE HORSE CHAY.</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bubb</span> was gay and free, fair, fat, and forty three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blooming as a Peony in buxom May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The toast she long had been of Farringdon Within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she fill’d the better half of a one horse chay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mrs. Bubb said to her lord, “you can, Bubb, well afford,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whate’er a Common Councilman in prudence may;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We’ve no brats to plague our lives, and the soap concern it thrives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us take a trip to Brighton in the one horse chay.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mr. Bubb said to his wife, “now, I think upon’t, my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis three weeks, at least, to next boiling day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dog days are set in, and London’s growing thin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I’ll order out old Nobbs, and the one horse chay.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Nobbs, it must be told, was rather fat and old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its colour was white, and it had been gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was round as a scot, and, when roundly whipt, would trot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full five miles an hour in a one horse chay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_157" id="page_157">{157}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When at Brighton they were hous’d, and had stuff’d and carous’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er a bowl of arrack Punch, Mr. Bubb did say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I’ve ascertained, my dear, the mode of dipping here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the ostler who is cleaning up my one horse chay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You’re shut in a box, ill convenient as the stocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eighteen pence each time are obliged to pay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Court corruption here, says I, makes everything so high.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I wish I had come without my one horse chay.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“As I hope,” says she, “to thrive, ’tis flaying folks alive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king and these extortioners are leagued, I say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis encouraging of such, to go and pay so much,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we’ll set them at defiance with our one horse chay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Old Nobbs I’m sure and sartin, you may trust with gig or cart in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He takes every matter in a very easy way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’ll stand like a post, while we dabble on the coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And return back, and dress in our one horse chay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So out they drove, all dress’d, so gaily, in their best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And finding in their rambles, a nice little bay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They uncased at their leisure, paddled out at their pleasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left everything behind in their one horse chay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But while so snugly sure, that all things were secure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They flounced about like porpoises, or whales at play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some young unlucky imps, who prowl’d about for shrimps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stole up to reconoitre the one horse chay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Old Nobbs in quiet mood, was sleeping as he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(He might possibly be dreaming of his corn, or hay):<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a foot did he wag, as they whipt out every rag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gutted all the contents of the one horse chay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When our pair were sous’d enough, and returning in their buff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, there was the vengeance, and Old Nick to pay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Madam shrieked in consternation, Mr. Bubb he swore damnation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find the empty state of the one horse chay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Come, bundle in with me, we must squeeze for once,” says he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“And manage this here business, as best we may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We’ve no other way to choose, not a moment must we lose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the tide will float us off in our one horse chay.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So noses, sides, and knees, altogether they did squeeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pack’d in little compass, they trotted it away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As dismal as two dummies, head and hands stuck out like mummies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From beneath the little apron of the one horse chay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159">{159}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mr. Bubb ge-upp’d in vain, and strove to jerk the rein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nobbs found he had his option to work or play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he wouldn’t mend his pace, though they fain would have run race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To escape the merry gazers at the one horse chay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, good people laugh your fill, and fancy if you will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For I’m fairly out of breath, and have had my say;)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trouble and the rout, to wrap and get them out,<br /></span>

contrast them with things as they were in their youth. Farming, as
it used to be carried out, could never pay now. In war time the
farmers did well; in January, 1801, wheat was 137s. per quarter,
and rose higher. But according to the Earl of Warwick, in a speech
in Parliament (November 14, 1800), they did not benefit much by
it&mdash;it was <i>light come, light go</i>, with them. “He wondered not at
the extravagant style of living of some of the farmers, who could
afford to play guinea whist, and were not contented with drinking
wine, but even mixed brandy with it.” The small farms, with their
little fields, cut even smaller by the huge hedges and ditches,
soil undrained, no machinery, the earth merely scratched by the
plough, could never grow wheat to sell at 32<i>s.</i> or 34<i>s.</i> per
quarter, or to rear beef and mutton, to compete against imported
meat. </p></div>

<span class="i0">My father was a farmer, who banished grief and woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mother was a dairy maid&mdash;that’s 90 years ago.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My father had a little farm, a harrow and a plough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mother had some pigs and fowls, a pony and a cow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They didn’t hire a servant, but they both their work did do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I have heard my parents say, just 90 years ago.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The rent that time was not so high by far, as I will pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now one family’s nearly twice as big as then were ten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I was born, my father used to harrow, plough and sow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think I’ve heard my mother say, ’twas 90 years ago.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To drive the plough my father did a boy engage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until that I had just arrived to seven years of age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So then he did no servant want, my mother milk’d the cow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the lark, I rose each morn, to go and drive the plough.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The farmer’s wives in every way themselves the cows did milk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They did not wear the dandy veils, and gowns made out of silk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_186" id="page_186">{186}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They did not ride blood horses, like the farmer’s wives do now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The daughters went a milking and the sons went to the plough.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When I was fifteen years of age, I used to thrash and sow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harrowed, ploughed, and in harvest time I used to reap and mow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I was 20 years of age, I could manage well the farm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could hedge and ditch, or plough, and sow, or thrash within the barn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At length when I was 25, I took myself a wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compelled to leave my father’s house as I had changed my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The younger children, in my place, my father’s work would do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then daily, as an husbandman, to labour I did go.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My wife and me, though very poor, could keep a pig and cow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She could sit and spin and knit, and I the land could plough.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There nothing was upon a farm, at all, but I could do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I find things very different now,&mdash;that’s many years ago.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We lived along contented, and banished pain and grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We had not occasion then to ask for parish relief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_187" id="page_187">{187}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now my hairs are grown quite grey, I cannot well engage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To work as I had used to do, I’m 90 years of age.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now that I am feeble grown, and poverty do feel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, for relief I go, they shove me into a Whig Bastile,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I may hang my hoary head, and pine in grief and woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father did not see the like, just 90 years ago.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When a man has laboured all his life to do his country good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s respected just as much when old, as a donkey in a wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His days are gone and past, and he may weep in grief and woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The times are very different now to 90 years ago.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now I am 90 years of age, if for relief I do apply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must go into a Whig Bastile to end my days and die,<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Although</span> the Mutiny of the Fleet at the Nore does not properly
belong to this century, yet it so nearly approached it (1797), and
was of such national importance for the time being, that I venture
to insert a ballad respecting it. The Navy was in a bad state. Many
men had been impressed; they were badly paid and badly fed; and
their punishment, for the slightest infraction of discipline, was
fearful, 50 to 500 lashes, according to the temper of the captain,
being no infrequent punishment for very venial offences. Early in
the year the men sent in very respectful memorials to Lord Howe,
telling him of their grievances. No notice was taken of it, and the
men, probably ignorantly, committed a gross breach of discipline in
combining together and opening communications with each other
throughout the Fleet. They plotted to seize the ships and expel the
officers; but it became known, and the Admiral gave orders to sail
to sea. The men refused to do so, until their grievances had been
looked into and redressed. This was promised and granted, but still
the men were suspicious that faith would not be kept with them, and
they set some of their officers ashore. Lord Howe, however, went to
the Fleet at St. Helen’s, and showed them an Act of Parliament,
granting their demands, and this pacified that portion of the
Fleet.</p>

<p>But at the Nore there was open mutiny; they blockaded the entrance
to the Thames, and fired on several ships entering or departing.
This could not be endured, and the Admiralty removed the buoys.
Provisions ran short, and some men-of-war were sent alongside, with
orders to sink those ships that did not surrender. They gave in one
by one, and the chief ringleader, Richard Parker (a man of some
education), and several others were hanged; but they were long
regarded as martyrs. Parker was buried in the churchyard of St.
Mary Matfelon, Whitechapel. </p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_218" id="page_218">{218}</a></span></p>

<span class="i0">O, don’t be vex’d, the Queen replied, you know I love you well,<br /></span>

There being no railways, and posting being fatiguing, he went by

Leith on the 14th, not landing, however, till the next day. His
visit was not remarkable for anything except the multiplicity of
his costumes. He embarked dressed as a private individual; he
landed as an Admiral; he dined in full Highland costume (when Sir
Walter Scott acted as principal Steward); and at another dinner
posed as a Field Marshal. He did very little during his stay,
leaving Scotland on August 29, arriving at Greenwich on September

<h3>THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE.</h3>

<p>1 <span class="smcap">Now</span> it came to pass that the land had rest for seventeen years.</p>

<p>2 For the Britons had subdued their enemies, even the French, and
restored peace to all the Continent.</p>

<p>3 Nevertheless the people groaned by reason of oppression, and of the
multitude of taxes which was laid upon them to support the rich and the
great with pensions and rewards.</p>

<p>4 And they cried and petitioned for redress, but their prayers were not
heard.</p>

<p>5 And George the Fourth was gathered to his fathers, and William reigned
in his stead.</p>

<p>6 Now there was at this time a mighty man of renown called Arthur.</p>

<p>7 And he gained the confidence of the King, and abused his ear with
falsities respecting the people.</p>

<p>8 And the people were much displeased with the power of this man of war,
for he ruled them as he had done his soldiers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_314" id="page_314">{314}</a></span></p>

<p>9 And their eyes were turned towards a certain nobleman whose
possessions lieth north of the Tyne.</p>

<p>10 Arthur feeling that he could rule no longer, resigned his authority,
and the King elected that nobleman, even Grey, whose possessions lieth
north of the Tyne, to be ruler under him over the people.</p>

<p>11 And he stood before the King, and said, O King, live for ever, thy
people have been long afflicted with heavy burdens which they cannot
bear, and their cries and lamentations ascend to heaven.</p>

<p>12 And the King was troubled in his mind at these sayings, and he caused
the records of the realm to be brought before him, and then he found
that his subjects were not fairly represented; and he was in much
agitation of mind, and trembled exceedingly and cried with a loud voice,
What shall I do?</p>

<p>13 And the noble, even Grey, said unto him, We must endeavour to amend
these things; and, oh King, if thou wilt give me permission, such a law
shall be framed that all the land will rejoice.</p>

<p>14 And the King said, Do as it pleaseth thee best in this matter.</p>

<p>15 Then Grey called all the representatives of the people together, and
shewed them the new law which he had framed for the people’s benefit.</p>

<p>16 But several of those who were interested with regard to money, lifted
up their voices against it.</p>

<p>17 Nevertheless the thing did prevail, in that house, the Assembly of
the People, called the House of Commons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_315" id="page_315">{315}</a></span></p>

<p>18 But when this same law was brought before the Lords, they laughed it
to scorn, saying amongst themselves, Shall we be deprived of all the
good things we have enjoyed so long? Shall we divide the spoil amongst
those we despise? And, as it were, with the voice of one man, they said,
No!</p>

<p>19 Now the High Priests of the nation consulted amongst themselves, and
said, Alas! what will become of us if this law passeth? We must then bid
farewell to all that we have held so dear.</p>

<p>20 And the lamentation amongst the High Priests was very great, for
every one of them lamented as if he had lost his first born.</p>

<p>21 And they came unto the Council of the Nation, even the House of
Lords, and said, We will not have this law to pass.</p>

<p>22 For, although we are paid, and well paid, to teach the people, yet in
our wisdom it seemeth good unto us to keep them ignorant.</p>

<p>23 For, be it known unto you, that, unless they are kept ignorant, and
deprived of power, no man can govern them.</p>

<p>24 And the Lords listened unto these speeches, and would not allow the
good law to pass.</p>

<p>25 Then stood the great and good noble, even Grey, before the King, and
said, thou knowest thy nobles and the high priests of the land will not
allow this law to pass.</p>

<p>26 Therefore I lay my commission at thy feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_316" id="page_316">{316}</a></span></p>

<p>27 And the king answered and said, do as it seemeth best to thee.</p>

<p>28 And Grey bowed himself to the earth, and departed from the presence
of the King.</p>

<p>29 And the King was troubled in spirit, and he sent in haste for Arthur,
even the mighty man of renown.</p>

<p>30 And Arthur arose, and girded up his loins, and stood before the King.</p>

<p>31 And the King said unto him, Arthur, I know thee to be a man in whom
is the spirit of wisdom and of valour, I am sorely troubled in mind
respecting this affair. What shall I do?</p>

<p>32 Arthur answered and said, be not troubled, neither let thy spirit be
cast down, for I can rule these people easily, and with a rod of iron
must they be ruled: grant unto me the commission, and I will make them
obedient.</p>

<p>33 And the King said, do as seemeth good in thine own eyes.</p>

<p>34 But when the people heard these things they were sorely grieved; and
became exceedingly enraged.</p>

<p>35 And said, shall this man of war, who is an enemy to liberty, reign
over us?</p>

<p>36 And the people from the land’s end, even unto Johnny Groat’s house,
rose up, as it were with one consent; and in every village, and every
city, and in every town, did they rise up and meet together in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_317" id="page_317">{317}</a></span> open
air to shew their hatred of Arthur, and of his oppression, and their
determination to be free.</p>

<p>37 And the multitudes were exceeding great, that no man might number
them, and they bore banners, having on them painted various devices.</p>

<p>38 And the cry of the people was great, and the noise of their shouting
was like the sound of many waters.</p>

<p>39 And they cried, if Arthur is to rule us, to thy tents, O, Britons!</p>

<p>40 Now, the great, and the just men, and the good amongst the people,
stood up, and spake with a loud voice, saying,</p>

<p>41 Be it known unto you, O, Britons, that Arthur can do nothing without
money, therefore refuse you to pay taxes till you are made free.</p>

<p>42 And the people shouted, and cried, We will give no money till we are
free; and having sung a war-like song, every man went to his own house.</p>

<p>43 Now, when the king heard of these things he was sore afraid, and he
told Arthur to depart from his presence, and he called Grey before him.</p>

<p>44 And he said, thy wisdom is great, get this bill passed, else we be
all dead men.</p>

<p>45 And the thing was done in haste, for great fear and trembling had
fallen upon them.</p>

<p>46 And the Nobles and the high priests agreed unto the bill, for they
were sore afraid, and quaked much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_318" id="page_318">{318}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nind"><span class="smcap">At</span> Manchester, on September 18, 1838, an Association called the
“Anti-Corn-Law League” was formed, having for its object the
abolition of the duties on the importation of corn, avowedly to
cheapen the food of the people. The principal agitators were
Richard Cobden, John Bright, Charles Villiers, etc., and by holding
meetings all over the country, lecturing, and distributing
handbills and ballads, the Corn Importation Bill was eventually
passed, June 26, 1846, when, there being no further occasion for
its existence, the League was dissolved. Cobden was richly rewarded
for his efforts, as a national subscription was raised for him,
which realized nearly £80,000. </p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nind"><span class="smcap">After</span> any great National movement, the ferment takes some time to
subside. Many agitators find their occupation gone, and look around
for some other strife to stir up. There is always an advanced
Radical school in every nation, and after the Reform Bill was
settled, “the People’s Charter” took its place. What was required
were the six following “Points”:&mdash;<i>Universal Suffrage, Vote by
Ballot, Annual Parliaments, Payment of the Members, the Abolition
of the Property Qualification, and equal Electoral Districts</i>. In
1838 they made armed demonstrations in several parts of the
country, and rioting took place in 1839. In 1848 monster petitions
in its favour were presented to Parliament, and on April 10 of that
year 200,000 men were invited to assemble on Kennington Common, and
march to the Houses of Parliament. About one-tenth of them
appeared, and, having full knowledge of the number of troops and
special constables who would oppose their progress, they thought
“discretion the better part of valour” and dispersed to their
homes. This was the last of “the Charter.” </p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nind">I have purposely refrained from giving any Nigger songs, although
they belong to Street melody, except in the case of “Jim Crow,”
which was the first of the flood which has been let loose upon us.
There were many versions, but I have here given the copyright
words, as sung by the author, and original “Jim Crow,” Thomas D.
Rice, or, as he was better known, “Adelphi Rice.” He introduced it,
in 1836, into a play called “A Flight to America,” and it so
tickled the ears of the groundlings that it became the most popular
of all modern street ballads. We may wonder what merit our
grandfathers and fathers found in it, but it created an absolute

apostle of Temperance, was born at Thomastown, Co. Tipperary, Ireland,
October 10, 1790. He was ordained in 1814, and was appointed to a chapel
in Cork. Here he interested himself much in the condition of the poor,
and in 1838, his attention having been called by a Quaker to the evils
of drunkenness, he began his famous total abstinence campaign, enrolling
in the course of five months one hundred and fifty thousand converts. On
one visit to Galway he administered the pledge to one hundred thousand
persons in one day. His influence over the working classes, especially
of the Irish, was enormous, and the amount of good he did is
incalculable. He did not confine his exertions in the cause of
temperance to Ireland, but visited England and America. He died December
8, 1856.</p></div>

1832, and its success was such, that the Chap books vanished as if by

which, although unsightly, was as profitable as were the heaps of Mr.
Boffin in Charles Dickens’s “Our Mutual Friend.” This mound, so it is
said, once had a curious clearance. It was bought, in its entirety, and
sent over to Russia, to help make bricks to rebuild Moscow; and the
ground on which it stood was sold to a company for £15,000.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> Breeze is the technical term for the sifted ashes mixed

Battle Bridge, and the neighbourhood renamed King’s Cross. It surmounted
a <i>Camera obscura</i>, and this was atop of a building, which in its turn,
was alternately a police station and a public-house. It was a miserable
affair, only made of brick and cement, and, after cumbering the ground
for a few years, it was pulled down.</p></div>

labourer had in those days, low rent, meal, skim milk, etc., and
constant work, wet or fine. Money then had more purchasing power, and
eight shillings was worth at least fifteen of the present currency. Now,
thanks to Mr. Joseph Arch and other agitators, the agricultural labourer
has, presumably, higher wages, but he has higher rent to pay, his
privileges are curtailed or annulled, and he has lost the sympathy of
his employer. Paid by the hour, he is discharged as soon as it comes on
to rain hard, instead of, as in the old days, being paid for a whole
day, even if he only worked part of it.</p></div>

His advising the Queen, and consequent intimate and personal knowledge
of all that was going on during the Russian war, coupled with the fact
that he was a foreigner, led the unthinking to believe that he was
secretly helping Russia&mdash;a report of which he seems to have been well
aware (<i>vide</i> Sir T. Martin’s “Life of the Prince Consort,” vol. iii. p.
219, March, 1855). I recollect very well the rumour that he had been
imprisoned in the Tower, and a comic paper had an engraving of two
cabmen meeting, and one saying to the other, “Have yer ’eard the noose?
Vhy, Prince Halbert along with two other Commander-in-Chiefs have been
sent to the Tower; which Lewis Napoleon diwulged ’em a sending of five
pound notes to the Emperor of Rooshia, and so he blowed the gaff” (told

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
